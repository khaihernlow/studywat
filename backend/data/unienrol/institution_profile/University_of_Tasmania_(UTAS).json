You may be eligible for the 3 semester course if you have a Bachelor degree in a science field with a major in Environmental Management and Spatial Sciences completed to a standard of achievement that is deemed acceptable by the College. Students in the 3 semester course are exempt from the transition units in their first year and require 50 credit points. Units should be selected to fill in knowledge and skill gaps and will  depend on the applicant’s disciplinary strengths. Four semester students should complete 200 credit points. All students complete a second year consisting of 100 credit points. In second year, 50 credit points will consist of the independent Research Thesis Pathway, or Professional Research Pathway. If a student meets the requirements for entry into our independent research stream, then the units KGA742 Research Thesis A and KGA743 Research Thesis B will replace KGA703 Professional Research Methods and KGA704 Professional Research Practice. Independent Research stream requires a coursework average of 75% or over in the first year of the Master of Environmental Geospatial Science (full-time equivalent) and approval of a research topic from both a supervisor and the Unit Co-ordinator. Units in this degree contribute either 12.5 or 25 credit points per unit to your total. Look at the individual unit details to see the credit points and other details for each unit.
