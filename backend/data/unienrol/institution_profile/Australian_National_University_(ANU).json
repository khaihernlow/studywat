Semester/Autumn and Winter/Second Semester/Spring) in order to continue in the Bachelor of Environment and Sustainability Advanced (Honours). Courses contributing towards the majors or minors but not listed in the Science course list will also contribute towards the 96 unit Science requirement for students completing the first 144 units of the program and therefore will contribute towards the minimum 70% weighted average mark. Students who do not achieve a minimum 70% Weighted Average Mark in all science courses and courses contributing towards the 96 units Science requirement will be transferred to the Bachelor of Environment and Sustainability. *Students must complete 144 units and achieve a minimum 70% Weighted Average Mark (calculated from the 36 units of courses in disciplines cognate to the Honours specialisation, excluding 1000-level courses, with the highest marks) and satisfy all admission requirements specified in the Honours specialisation in order to commence the Honours specialisation.
