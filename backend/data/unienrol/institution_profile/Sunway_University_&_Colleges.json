The tailored content delivery will cater specifically to the unique needs of educational research, covering areas such as skill acquisition, literature review techniques, methodologies, and ethical considerations. We also include a workshop on generative artificial intelligence (AI), equipping you with cutting-edge skills relevant to the demands of 21st-century teaching and learning.\nThere are nine (9) series of workshops that postgraduate students can attend before embarking on thesis writing. The first six (6) series of workshops are compulsory and the last three (3) series of workshops are optional.\nWorkshop 1: Introduction to Research \nWorkshop 2: Reviewing the Literature \nWorkshop 3: Research Purpose, Research Objectives, Research Questions and Hypotheses \nWorkshop 4: Quantitative Research Methodology \nWorkshop 5: Qualitative Research Methodology \nWorkshop 6: Research Proposal and Thesis Writing \nWorkshop 7: Generative AI for Research \nWorkshop 8: SPSS for Beginners \nWorkshop 9: NVivo for Beginners\nResearch Colloquium\nAlongside a series of workshops, postgraduate students are encouraged to attend research colloquia, which offer opportunities for networking, presenting their work, and receiving constructive feedback from peers and faculty. This platform not only enhances presentation skills but also stimulates critical thinking by exposing students to a diverse range of research topics.
