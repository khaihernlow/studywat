It focuses on design enquiry and synthesis, with modest expectations in terms of design resolution, and develops core design skills. It is supported by learning assignments in the other areas of study regarding: abilities in mixed media, including architectural hand-drawing and digital representation (Communication); understanding of architectural technique, including material-element-component assembly (Communication); ethical solutions through material, structural and environmental concerns (Technology); and histories, theories and critical thinking of architecture (Humanities) COMMON MODULES Architectural Design Studio 1 Architectural Representation Architectural History and Theory Architectural Design Studio 2 Construction Technology Digital Architecture DEGREE LEVEL 2 Year 2 Design develops creative design skills from Year One, whilst emphasising the contingencies of site andcommunity/users, with a focus upon ethical design and climate literacy. It continues Year One’s focus on design enquiry and synthesis, with extended expectations regarding design resolution. It is supported by learning assignments in the other areas regarding: abilities in mixed media, including architectural hand-drawing and digital representation (Communication); ethical challenges of architectural design, including the climate crisis (Technology); applying climate literacy and design ethics with specific regard to well-being, health and safety, climate crisis and design for all (Technology) (Practice); guiding principles of climate literate architectural techniques (Technology); and academic research and writing skills and developing critical thinking (Humanities). COMMON MODULES Architectural Design Studio 3 Integrated Technology Critical and Cultural Studies Architectural Design Studio 4 Environment and Behaviour Energy and Building DEGREE LEVEL 3 Year 3 Design challenges students to demonstrate critical judgement in their design work. It further extends students’ understanding and skills regarding design enquiry and synthesis, whilst supporting students in demonstrating extended skill and abilities in design resolution, evident in cogent alignment of design narrative, tectonic and detail. Students undertake a major design project, supported by integrated learning and teaching in Technology, Humanities and Practice and fully explore and demonstrate their design understanding across a series of scales, ranging from the city to detail, as well as their ability to integrate and synthesise knowledge and skills from different subject areas. It is supported by learning assignments in the other areas regarding: abilities in mixed media, including architectural hand-drawing and digital representation (Communication); ethical challenges of architectural design, including the climate crisis (Technology); professional context of architectural practice and design practice, including an architect’s responsibilities regarding climate emergency and the health, safety and well-being of users (Practice); values and challenges of group working in the professional/industry context and the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration to creative design and problem solving (Practice); and perspective regarding the histories, cultural context and ethical dimensions of architecture and architectural design, underpinned by skills and abilities in academic research and writing (Humanities).

DEGREE LEVEL 3 Students will make use of their previous studies and industrial experience to extend their familiarity in the field of multimedia technology and to refine their personal and professional development. Students will move further into media scripting technology and more advanced multimedia development and techniques. Furthermore, you are required to learn and analyse the perceptions and feedback of your users, for example, socio-economic factor, cultures and regional considerations in User Experience and HCI and Usability. A final year project requires them to investigate and develop a solution for a real-world problem – they will demonstrate their ability to combine technical knowledge, critical thinking and analytical skills to produce a personal achievement portfolio.
