        "core": "Researching as a Writer 1: Icebergs and Audience This is one of two six-week creative writing research modules. The main focus is on research related to writerly craft. It takes as its focus Hemingway’s model of the iceberg that the reader only sees one-eighth of. Students will understand, through practice, what the other seven-eighths consists of in terms of the practical, historical, and speculative research necessary to bring a piece of creative writing to life for a reader. It will involve looking at how writers build worlds, characters and stories, how they research settings, time periods and ideas. We’ll consider the use of archives, mood boards, video resources, images, paintings, newspapers, other fictional texts, websites, wider reading and experiences to aid them in creation of believable worlds, characters and stories, imagery, voice, or supplementary knowledge in poetry/experimental work. It will also look at the way’s writers work to find creativity and ideas, and habits they use to enhance their practice. Researching as a Writer 2: Practising Ideas, Articulating Practice The second six-week research module tackles how students approach the challenge of writing creatively about their practice in ways that stretch the standard academic ‘analytical’ writing and yet encourage them to understand and articulate the research issues and questions that underpin specific projects, and their emerging sense of their wider writing practice (and its thematic concerns). It gives students the opportunity to situate their writing, and thinking, amongst contemporary issues and ideas. These concerns may range across considerations of creativity, play, knowledge, gender, identity, sexuality, class, and the relationship between aesthetics and politics. Students explore alternative traditions of articulating practice from the manifesto to the experimental essay and the rich heritage of ‘poetics’ as a speculative hybrid discourse, a mid-point between ‘theory’ and ‘practice’. The module builds upon the Benchmark Statement’s commitment to ‘Creative Writing as an academic pursuit [that] develops a range of cognitive abilities related to the aesthetic, ethical and social contexts of human experience.’ As such, it fosters ‘the ability to see the world from different perspectives, both as a life skill and as an essential part of artistic practice’ (QAA 6). The ability to conceptualise their practice in relation to research questions and contributions to knowledge is a crucial M level skill that will assist them in their professional development, for example in funding applications, and PhD work. Developing Writing 1: Craft, Form and Exploratory Writing This 12-week module aims to develop your writing practice and craft skills in relation to your chosen research project and its genre(s). It will also encourage experimentation with writing, both in terms of pushing your current practice in new directions, and in trying new forms and ideas. Half of the module will be devoted to issues of craft, form and genre; and half will be devoted to ‘exploratory’ writing as ways of developing both your general sense of craft, and the specific project you want to select as the main focus of this 12-week block. It is entirely up to you whether you continue with this project beyond these 12 weeks. The first 6 weeks explore genre, craft and form, using in-situ tasks and a focus upon Weird Fiction as a hybrid genre that takes elements of horror, sci-fi and other forms and yet has developed a singular identity in recent years. The next 6 weeks of ‘exploratory writing’ encourages you to tackle aspects of your chosen research project from productively ‘slanted’ angles. As such, we will adopt Fernando Pessoa’s practice of ‘heteronymity’ to self-multiply into different writing identities with discrete writerly concerns and styles. Each week we will frame the session by looking at one of the 6 ‘values, qualities, or peculiarities of literature’ that Italo Calvino regards as aspects of creative practice that ‘only literature can give us.’ It is entirely up to you whether you continue with this project beyond these 12 weeks Developing Writing 2: Genre Case Study This 12-week module is divided into two halves that put into practice an understanding of the various functions and significance of genre, by enabling the students to experience 6 different genres and the craft challenges specific to them. The first six weeks are devoted to weekly specialist sessions wherein a practitioner, expert in a given genre, will lead a session on their experience of working within it, in terms of crafts techniques and market considerations for a professional context. It is understood that the genre the student ultimately selects, must be different from the project they are pursuing for the CREW 5012 module. Sessions may include genres and forms as various as TV Sitcom, Speculative Fiction, Working-Class fiction, Memoir writing, Crime fiction and the poetry sequence. After these 6 weeks, the students select the genre they want to explore; and each following weekly workshop will be led by several students responsible for bringing in an excerpt from their work in this form, an example of published work in this form, and craft challenges and tips for discussion. The Writing Ecosystem 1: Navigating networks This module will focus on markets for creative writing in terms of routes into publishing and the production of written work. It will also investigate ecosystems that provide work, professional development and support for writers. We will look at submitting work for publication, applying for grants, writing as a business and the publishing/production industries. We will also explore the avenue of producing your own work independently, both in terms of self-publishing and indie filmmaking via crowdfunding etc. The module will reinforce the importance of collaboration and explore the significance of the ‘Author’s Story.’ The Writing Ecosystem 2: Performance, Presentation, Pedagogy This module is the second ‘Ecosystems’ module that faces outwards towards employability broadly conceived as equipping you with skills for a range of career contexts, as well as a sound understanding of Creative Writing as a discipline. In the current professional landscape, it’s imperative that writers are able to present themselves and their work, as being involved in events and elements of self-promotion are a necessity. Doing so is predicated upon developing an understanding of what Creative Writing ‘is,’ and the different purposes and audiences (or, ‘ecosystems’ it might serve). Addressing different aspects of Creative Writing pedagogy, and ‘creativity,’ will allow you to simultaneously develop new knowledge about how we learn, and be able to articulate the transferable skills that your subject embodies. We will focus upon the applicability of such knowledge: both how you might personally use it to present your work to an audience, and how you might develop teaching materials to use in future workshops of your own. The aim is to increase your ability to confidently present your work, and articulate your processes and practice for a variety of audiences; formal interviews, post-reading Q+A, running workshops or teaching creative writing as part of a portfolio career. How do you select and present materials to read in public? How would you run a workshop; what would you focus upon, and what teaching methods would you use? These are just some of the questions that will preoccupy us. Final Dissertation The final dissertation module is an extended creative project of your choice—for example a collection of poems or short stories, a novel extract, a creative non-fiction piece, or an experimental cross-platform/genre piece. The dissertation module will be supported by a critical or reflective commentary. Total word count is between 15-25,000 words, including a 2000-word reflective commentary, and a project synopsis. The project may well be exactly the work you have been planning since the early modules on the programme, or it may be something that has developed more recently, stimulated by other work encountered: the choice is yours. You will be divided into peer ‘response groups’ for further support.",

Modules studied: Sustainable Development – covers the key concepts of sustainable development and sustainability. This module discusses social, ecological and economic sustainability concepts and encourages you to develop a critical appreciation of the sustainable development debate Sustainable Development Sustainable Buildings – introduces you to the main aspects of sustainability in regards to the built environment, exploring the environmental, economic and social/cultural issues that need to be considered for achieving successful building design and operation Sustainable Buildings Sustainable Energy – provides a systematic understanding of the global energy system and energy sources. The module examines the physical principles and application of current technologies and their environmental impacts, and how these interact in energy systems Sustainable Energy Building Physics – provides you with a thorough understanding of the physical processes that govern how buildings respond to the external environment. This module examines the thermal properties of buildings, how daylight and natural ventilation interact with buildings and how this affects the quality of the indoor environment Building Physics Building Performance Modelling – enables you to understand why and how building simulation can be used to analyse building thermal, daylight and ventilation performance. This module will enable you to make appropriate selections of simulation methods, analyse results and give coherent recommendations Building Performance Modelling Energy Analysis Techniques – This very practical module will equip you with the skills to analyse energy data from buildings and industrial processes, and to carry out energy audits and surveys to identify energy and greenhouse gas saving opportunities. Issues such as heating, lighting, ventilation and general energy use are considered, and crucially, ways to bring about energy savings and how to make energy saving recommendations, sometimes as much as 20% with zero (or very low) investment. The case studies we use are mainly for non domestic buildings but all of the techniques can also be applied to dwellings.\n\nThe module includes the theory behind energy analysis, and we carry out practical building surveys, and data analysis in lab sessions, the assessment being to prepare a report similar to one you would produce as a professional energy efficiency consultant. Energy Analysis Techniques Study Skills and Research Methods – provides the skills necessary to successfully complete a research project of a high standard, introducing you to a range of research methodologies and practices relevant to the successful completion of the MSc Study Skills and Research Methods Dissertation – you will complete the MSc by undertaking a building-related dissertation on a topic of your choice, supervised by an experienced member of the research staff Dissertation Optional modules: Choose one from two (three distance learning) optional modules Leading Change for Sustainability - aims to equip students with theoretical knowledge and practical skills to enable them to play an effective leadership role in promoting sustainability and pro-environmental behaviour change. The module focuses upon understanding and influencing human behaviour, drawing upon a range of theoretical frameworks and contemporary case studies on topics including energy, climate change, transport and waste. There is a highly participatory teaching and learning approach and a chance for students to develop as reflective practioners by implementing and learning from real-life behaviour change interventions.

        "core": "Sustainable Development covers the key concepts of sustainable development and sustainability. This module discusses social, ecological and economic sustainability concepts and encourages you to develop a critical appreciation of the sustainable development debate Sustainable Development Sustainable Energy describes the sources of energy, and how they are exploited with a wide range of technologies, with an emphasis on their environmental impacts and long-term sustainability Sustainable Energy Sustainable Buildings introduces you to the main aspects of sustainability in regards to the built environment, exploring the environmental, economic and social/cultural issues that need to be considered for achieving successful building design and operation. Topics covered include climate-responsive design, low/ zero carbon performance, energy and water consumption, human factors and urban planning Sustainable Buildings Resource-Efficient Design provides a grounded understanding of resource-efficient design in both industrial and non-industrial contexts. Resource-Efficient Design This module will adopt a 'whole systems' perspective to the introduction of students to the design process and will encourage them to analyse each stage of development in terms of its impact on resource use and overall energy consumption Energy Analysis Techniques is a particularly practical module that will equip you with the skills to analyse energy data from buildings and industrial processes, and to carry out energy audits and surveys to identify energy and greenhouse gas saving opportunities. Energy Analysis Techniques Issues such as heating, lighting, ventilation and general energy use are considered, and crucially, ways to bring about energy savings and how to make energy saving recommendations, sometimes as much as 20% with zero (or very low) investment. The case studies we use are mainly for non domestic buildings but all of the techniques can also be applied to dwellings.\nThe module includes the theory behind energy analysis, and we carry out practical building surveys, and data analysis in lab sessions, the assessment being to prepare a report similar to one you would produce as a professional energy efficiency consultant. Study Skills and Research Methods provides the skills necessary to successfully complete a research project of a high standard, introducing you to a range of research methodologies and practices relevant to the successful completion of the MSc Study Skills and Research Methods Dissertation will complete the MSc by undertaking a research project on a topic of your choice, supervised by an experienced member of research staff Dissertation Optional Modules: Leading Change for Sustainability aims to equip students with theoretical knowledge and practical skills to enable them to play an effective leadership role in promoting sustainability.

        "core": "Year 1 Leadership Practicum This module will provide a novel and leading edge perspective on leadership in contemporary organisational contexts. It will allow you to explore a range of perspectives on leadership looking at, for example, conventional trait and situational theories of leadership and considering these in comparison with more facilitative, relational and discursive approaches such as, transformational, charismatic and distributive leadership.  Additionally, this work will be underpinned with coaching and mentoring and the module will provide rich and varied opportunities for you to contextualise your experiences. Financial Decision Making The Financial Decision Making module considers the dynamics of numerical data and information and your role in current business and management practices and business development. It will be delivered through a combination of face-to-face tutoring and distance learning and at different levels, in order to respond to different participant pre-accomplishment and ability. The module will employ case studies which illustrate how to interpret and effectively utilise financial information in a manner which adds value to business decisions and integrates financial information in the light of the realities of business strategy shaping in the contemporary era. Strategy in Turbulent Times The module will use a simulation and the teaching will be based around various aspects of understanding of the questions and situations generated. Business analytics will be covered during this module together with opportunities to work with techniques on real case studies and live business issues. The module will take you through conventional linear representations of strategy and progress to demonstrate and provide hands-on experience, through relating this back to your own professional experiences, to more incremental, complex and transformational approaches. Crucially, you will learn why strategies fail and succeed. Year 2 Social Entrepreneurship and Innovation in New Settings This module allows you to explore your academic and professional experiences in a novel context and engage in innovative and entrepreneurial behaviours. The work of the module is constructed around a number of ‘Sustainable Development Goals’. Current business challenges point at the need for new ways of thinking and new solutions. Such approaches can also be a driver for wider social change. The module introduces you to models and debates in the field of social entrepreneurship and social innovation, and examines some of the realities of rendering these operational. This module will also integrate research methods and field research, such as the field business project at Chiang Mai (Thailand). The team have access to a wide range of potential projects including, for example, Cocoa supply change management. Business and Sustainability Sustainability presents a contemporary domain in which organisations and business are obligated to balance constraints and pressures from both internal and external sources. Senior organisational figures and executives feel compelled to behave appropriately and therein resides a challenge – how to keep up-to-date with the latest information and research when resources in terms of time and work pressures are scarce. This module addresses the need for current and relevant research delivered in an applied manner so as to build and reinforce effectiveness, judgement and confidence in the contested area of business and sustainability. The module will be mindful of being presented without jargon yet will use and contextualise leading edge research with a view to stimulating novel and critical reflection on issues which are central and critical to organizational international business policy. Future of Work and Organizations This module is a capstone for the course. You will examine a wide range of stimulating and interesting topics emerging around, for example, the impact of artificial intelligence, crowdfunding, social enterprises, and virtual organisations. The module will include a series of company visits with the possibility of inter-institutional collaborative seminars. Students will relate the material of the module to the other modules of the programme drawing out inter-disciplinary and cross-modular themes and learning.",

Social and Cultural Themes of Sport\nThis module examines the development of sport and physical culture in Britain and continental Europe from the 1850s. This includes the emergence of amateurism and the on-going tension between the amateur ethos and the commercialisation of sport as well as the codification, modernisation and globalisation of sporting practices. Particular reference is made to the importance of social divisions, such as class, gender and race.\n\nSport, Politics and Policy\nThis module examines the relationship between sport and international politics, and looks at how government public policies have impacted on sport and explores identity politics in sport. The module is based around the history of mega-events such as the Olympic Games and also global sporting institutions like the International Olympic Committee and FIFA. In addition, sport in the Cold War is also examined.\n\nInvestigating Sports History: Research Methods\nThe primary aim of this module is to prepare students for their dissertation. It comprises two mandatory essays a Primary Source Analysis and a Dissertation Plan for which you will receive expert guidance, concerning historiography and methodology. Social and Cultural Themes of Sport Sport, Politics and Policy Investigating Sports History: Research Methods In addition, to help you specialise, you will choose one from the following: Sport, Writing and History \nThe module considers written social and cultural aspects of the representation of sport in Britain and in an international context. The central aim is to promote appreciation of an historical approach to imaginative literature and non-fiction including autobiography, sports journalism and popular writing. This will enable students better to identify and explain long-term changes in the representation of sport and recreation and its transmission to a wide range of readers and audiences. Sport, Writing and History Football: Past and Present\nThis module explores the history of the game, from its origins, and its development from both domestic and international perspectives. It is arranged both thematically and chronologically and includes: the origins of football; the early professionalization and commercialisation of the game; the emergence of international football; football and the media; the football manager; football fans; the modernisation of football and global actors, such as FIFA. \n\nThe History of Rugby\nThis module examines the social history of rugby, starting in the mid-19 century and the popularisation of the sport through Tom Brown’s Schooldays to the 1995 professionalisation of rugby union. Using film, oral history and primary sources, the module examines the development of the sport through the perspectives of class, gender and national identity. At each stage the history of the sport is related to the broader history of British society in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Football: Past and Present The History of Rugby",

You will complete this within three months of enrolment for full-time students and six months for part-time students. A range of compulsory and optional courses from the Researcher Development Programme form the basis of the TNA, which can be supplemented according to your specific needs (eg in languages, technical skills, etc). The TNA is submitted online with the support of your supervisor. Training Needs Analysis Formal Review\nAll research students registered on the Doctoral Researcher Programme carry out a Formal Review to confirm PhD as their award aim (This does not apply if you are studying for the MA/MSc by Research or if you are aiming for an MPhil). The Formal Review submission includes a detailed review of literature relevant to your topic along with discussion of your proposed research methods and work you have undertaken to that point—such as data collection and/or analysis, as well as your plans for the work required to complete your project. Students completing practice-based PhDs (for example where artistic creation is part of the research methodology) will also submit examples of practical work completed to that point. Formal Review Annual Review\nA formal Annual Review Panel is held to discuss in detail your proposed research objectives for the following year and the research project achievements of the previous year. Annual Review Progress Reports\nOnline progress reports are required at least once a month. As a research student you are required to discuss your work regularly with your supervisors as an essential part of the teaching and learning contract between you and the University. These Progress Reports are an important record of the interactions you have with your supervisors and really help keep your work on track to successful completion. Progress Reports Completion Period Thesis Submission\nThe submission of your thesis for examination is be accompanied by a thesis submission form which confirms the originality of the work. You will complete this form when your thesis is submitted to the Graduate School Office (GSO). Thesis Submission The Viva Voce Examination\nAll research degree students undergo an oral examination, the ‘viva voce’, which takes place after you have submitted your thesis to the GSO. The examination team consists of at least two academics with significant expertise in your field. Normally there will be one internal examiner (a member of staff of the University) and an external examiner who is chosen for their particular experience and academic status.. Your first supervisor will take responsibility for arranging the viva voce examination once the nominated examiners have been approved by your Faculty and the Director of Graduate School. The Viva Voce Examination Contact Hours\nFull-time research degree students are expected to undertake at least 35 hours a week of study throughout the year. Part-time students are expected to undertake 12 hours per week. This will include meeting regularly with your supervisor, as set out in the Code of Practice for Research Degree Students.

An indicative template and guidance will be provided to students. The log should have regular brief entries (at least every two weeks) and provide a commentary and reflection on making sense of the doctoral, work and general life experiences. The log does not employ academic references unless the student wishes to engage with particular sources as a part of the log and its experiences.\n\nThis log will operate, and be maintained, for the duration of the programme and will be submitted alongside the final thesis programme upon submission (minimum 2000 words in overall length). The student must receive a ‘pass’ mark for this element (pass threshold for progression). Non-achievement of a pass mark will require a resubmission of the log element.\n\nEstablishment of, and Engagement in, Action-Learning Sets - Action learning sets will be formed at the commencement of the programme. Action learning sets provide a well-established and acknowledged management development methodology which allows programme participants to exchange and learn in a structured manner. While these are essentially self-directed, these will be overseen at distance by supervisors/programme leader. Module 1 - Year 1/ Assignment 1 (Sept - Dec) –  A structured review of research and leading professional practice literature\nModule 2 - Year 1/ Assignment 2 (Dec - March) – Challenging assumptions underpinning practice - Research Paradigms and Philosophies\nModule 3 - Year 1 (March - June) - Development of the Research Design – Preparation for Field Work/ Pilot Study\nEnd Year 1 - Residential (June) Module 1 - Year 1/ Assignment 1 (Sept - Dec) –  A structured review of research and leading professional practice literature Module 2 - Year 1/ Assignment 2 (Dec - March) – Challenging assumptions underpinning practice - Research Paradigms and Philosophies Module 3 - Year 1 (March - June) - Development of the Research Design – Preparation for Field Work/ Pilot Study End Year 1 - Residential (June) Year 2 (Sept - Dec): Operation of the Pilot Study and Development of Thesis Year 3 to Year 4 (Full-time) and Year 4 to Year 6 (Part-time): Ongoing Field Work, Analysis of Findings and Writing up of Thesis Document Researcher Development Programme -Throughout the course of the programme, students will have the possibility of undertaking modules from the extensive suite of available modules provided by the Graduate School Office/Doctoral College. This facility will provide a diverse range of opportunities for students to complement and supplement their learning. If students wish to take these modules they will be supported in contacted the appropriate contact points and accessing them. The modules are in addition to the validated programme and not part of it. They are undertaken entirely on the volition of the student but the course team will support and advise students in concert with colleagues from wider areas. The programme structure allows students to complete the three input modules in year 1. Students who wish to complete the modules at a different pace will have two options: first, to submit outstanding assignments later in a negotiated extension timeline; secondly, - should they be unable to attend delivery of one of the three modules in the first year (due to private/professional circumstances) - to attend, for example, one or two modules in year 1 and join the new cohort in the following year 2 to undertake the remaining module(s) then. This pattern of three modules running each year will also allow students to catch up (on a cyclical /conveyor belt model) on resits should they not complete in year one or fail a first attempt. Students must successfully complete the assignments within the first two years of programme before being able to transfer to, and commence with, the thesis phase. From the beginning of the programme students will also be obligated to keep and make entries in a Research Log which will operate on a yearly assessment basis throughout the duration of the programme (more is detailed below on the Log).
