Research Methodology: Key Research Areas\nInfectious Diseases:\nThe rich biodiversity of Malaysia enables the discovery of novel compounds to fight infectious diseases. At Taylor’s University, the identified natural compounds will be examined for their bioactive properties as well as their mode of action. In addition to the antimicrobial research, the host-pathogen interaction research is focused to understand the disease manifestation in host cells. Key Research Areas Infectious Diseases: OR Non-Communicable Diseases:\nDiet, smoking, alcohol consumption, a sedentary lifestyle and stress have contributed to greater incidences of heart disease, respiratory disease, diabetes and cancer, among others. Available drugs for these diseases are often accompanied by undesirable side effects, not selective enough or simply too expensive. Hence, this cluster targets the discovery of novel lead compounds and to scientifically validate natural remedies for lifestyle-related chronic diseases. Non-Communicable Diseases: OR Environmental Research:\nResearch conducted in this cluster focuses in bioremediation, taxonomic identification of marine flora and to facilitate the development of mechanisms or processes that are in compliance with environmental laws. It will target improvement in resources savings, waste disposal and resolving environmental stress issues. In addition, researchers in this cluster also provide consultation and training in environmental management systems. Environmental Research: OR Food Science And Nutrition:\nThe broader aim of research in this cluster is to study the fundamentals and applied aspects of new functional foods, medical foods and nutraceuticals as well as new technologies that facilitate development of novel consumer products that enhance human health, food safety and functionality.
